-> Will be implementing 2 different screen for each subject
-> in first screen there will be all raw code for testing purposes
-> in second screen i'll be try to reduce the overall code and improve the approach by placing things as they should be

-> 3rd screen will be calculating overall marks and will show their result.(will be using companion obj(terminology for static keyword)).
-> 1st screen will be of default dialog boxes and 2nd screen will be of customized dialog boxes.
-> default dialog boxes cannot cover a whole long ques and options at the same time, so always use alert dialog boxes for short message.
